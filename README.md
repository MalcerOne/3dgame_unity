# Distopya
A 3D FPS game made by Andresa Bicudo e Rafael Malcervelli.

## Welcome to Distopya

In these woods, there was once a nuclear energy lab.
Until one day one of the reactors accidentally exploded and killed all of the scientists.
Since then, the distopian robots have been patrolling the area.

But there is a problem...There is a bigger reactor in the lab and these robots know exactly how to activate it.
Everyone is in danger and you can't let them do it!

Do you take the risk?
